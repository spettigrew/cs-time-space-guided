# why do we have big O notation?
# To evaluate performance.
# to find out the time it takes to complete a function (releative to other input sizes) 
# different computers run at different speeds
# efficiency

# O(n) --> linear
# O(n^2) -- quadratic
# O(1) -- constant -- the performance doesn't change regardless of input
# O(log n) -- logarithmic -- every time we double the input size, we only add one extra step
# O(2^n) -- exponential
# factorial
# O(n log n) -- linearithmic
